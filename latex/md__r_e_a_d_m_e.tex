You are to create software for modeling basic 2D graphics objects. The modeler will demonstrate the capabilities of 2D Graphics Modeler Inc.\+’s graphics engine. Potential customers will be looking for a 2D graphics rendering library which can be integrated into their own software suite.

You must use inheritance, composition, exception handlers, a virtual function, and at least two overloaded operators. At least one class should use templates. At least one class must contain a pointer (a copy constructor needs to be written and tested). Highlight the above in your code.

Use the Qt Q\+Painter low-\/level graphics rendering library to draw shapes on a Q\+Widget rendering area (refer to the Qt Basic Drawing Example documentation and source code as an example). Implement a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}} abstract base class which contains a Q\+Painter data member via an aggregation or composition relationship. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}} has pure virtual functions draw, move, perimeter \& area. Types of Shapes\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_line}{Line}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_polyline}{Polyline}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_polygon}{Polygon}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rectangle}{Rectangle}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_ellipse}{Ellipse}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}}. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}} Properties\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}} Dimensions, Pen Color, Pen Width, Pen Style, Pen Cap Style, Pen Join Style, Brush Color, Brush Style. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} Properties\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} String, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} Color, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} Alignment, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} Point Size, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} Font Family, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} Font Style, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} Font Weight (refer to shape\+\_\+input\+\_\+file\+\_\+specs.\+txt). \mbox{\hyperlink{class_line}{Line}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_polyline}{Polyline}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_polygon}{Polygon}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_rectangle}{Rectangle}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_ellipse}{Ellipse}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} Classes will override the virtual interface of base class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}} (i.\+e. interface inheritance).

All \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}} Types will be implemented as separate derived classes which inherit from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}}. Overload the equality and less than relational operators in base class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}}. These overloaded operators will compare shape object ids. This will support sorting shapes by id.

Disable copy operations (constructor, assignment operator) for all shape types. This can be accomplished by marking the copy constructor and assignment operator for class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape}} as being deleted.

You must implement the vector class as outlined in the \mbox{\hyperlink{vector_8h}{vector.\+h}} specification below. Vector will be used to store the 2D graphics objects displayed by the modeler. Your vector class is a close approximation to the S\+TL vector class. Vector supports the following basic operations\+: constructors for one or more arguments, default constructors, copy constructor, copy assignment, move constructor, move assignment and destructor. Vector also supports a basic iterator member type and member function begin() and end() operations. A partial outline/implementation of the above will be provided to the team.

$>$Extra Credit \mbox{[}+1 Pts\mbox{]}\+: Add ability to modify a shape’s properties (admin only)

$>$Extra Credit \mbox{[}+4 Pts\mbox{]}\+: Write a custom selection\+\_\+sort algorithm and two custom comparison functions compare\+\_\+shape\+\_\+perimeter, compare\+\_\+shape\+\_\+area. All functions are templated. The comparison functions are called via a function pointer passed to selection\+\_\+sort. This allows the algorithm to sort shapes by perimeter and area respectively. Selection\+\_\+sort must sort a vector of shapes by id (default) or alternatively via custom comparison functions.

Design a very readable, easy to use interface to demonstrate your program. Contingency handling should include addressing invalid input. No late projects will be accepted. Your team must demonstrate your project to me before it will be graded. Each teammate must identify their accomplishments on the project.

Write at least 10 agile stories before any software is developed. Each story must be in the proper format (As a ...). Each story must contain a detailed description, assignee, story point estimation, priority, list of tasks and tests, and definition of done. The team must identify a baseline story with a story point value of one; refer to group project homework assignment \#1 (gphw01) due March 26th.

Perform white box testing to validate that 2d modeler api is working as expected. Write white box unit tests and test plan; refer to gphw02 due May 5th.

Submit a U\+ML class diagram, at least three use-\/case and one state diagram with your project; refer to gphw03 due May 5th. The team must follow the Scrum process. The Scrum master must log all team meetings (i.\+e. daily scrum) and document the sprint backlog. The product owner must document the backlog. Project will consist of two three-\/week sprint sessions\+: sprint\#1 \& sprint\#2. Run Doxygen on your source code.

Run Valgrind to perform a memory leak check on your program. Teams must use QT, D\+O\+X\+Y\+G\+EN, and G\+IT. Only team members should have access to their repository. Valgrind will be used to verify that the software does not have memory leaks.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Rubric Requirements}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
The 2D Graphics Modeler must\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Provide satisfied customer testimonials (solicit for additional testimonials). Guest users may enter testimonials. The testimonials should be persistent between executions.
\item Provide “contact us” method with team name and logo
\item Display all graphic objects (i.\+e. shapes including text) in rendering window. The shape id will be displayed above each shape identifying it. The rendering area to display shapes must have minimum dimensions of 1000 pixels (horizontal) by 500 pixels (vertical). The coordinate system is defined such that the top left corner of the rendering area is located at point (0,0), the bottom right corner at point (1000,500).
\item Your program should read from a shape file that keeps track of all shapes currently being rendered by the 2D modeler. Shapes are identified by their type\+: line, polyline, polygon, rectangle, ellipse, text. Shapes have properties\+: shape dimensions, pen color, pen width, pen style, pen cap style, pen join style, brush color, brush shape. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_text}{Text}} has properties\+: shape dimensions, text string, text color, text alignment, text point size, text font family, text font style, text font weight. All shapes must also have a unique ID.
\item Your program should be able to move shapes, including text, being rendered. This is accomplished via a move shape form. All changes are visible in the rendering area. – administrator only
\item Your program should be able to add and remove shapes, including text, being rendered. This is accomplished via an add/remove shape form. All changes are visible in the rendering area. – administrator only
\item Produce a shape listing report sorted by shape id (at any time). All shape properties should be included in the report.
\item Produce a shape listing report of O\+N\+LY shapes with an area sorted by area (at any time). The shape type, id and area should be included in the report.
\item Produce a shape listing report of O\+N\+LY shapes with a perimeter sorted by perimeter (at any time). The shape type, id and perimeter should be included in the report.
\item Save all changes between executions
